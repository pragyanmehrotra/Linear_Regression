# Linear_Regression
Given a univariate Input output training data the program calculates the linear regression and outputs the equation of the line passing through these points with minimum error.

The script currently runs on the given data however it can easily be made to run on some other data, It also calculates the mean sqaured error of the model, basically it acts on 80 20 ratio i.e it trains on the 1st 80% of the input data and then test the line on the remaining 20% and calculates the mean sqaured error for it.
